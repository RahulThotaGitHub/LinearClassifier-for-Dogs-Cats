#LinearClassifier-for-Dogs-Cats  
I have started my ML journey.   
This project was just for practice.[Hands on learning]  
I coded and trained my liner classifier on the basis of 1)Flappiness Index & 2)Whisker Length of Dogs and cats.  
Used the data from random normal distribution curve , totaling to 100 dogs and 100 cats [100 data points for each of their features].  
Trained on 80% of total data and Tested on the remaining 20%.  
And also cross validated my traing data to get the best value for k [k is the no. of iterations it takes to find the best hypothesis for my ml algorithm]
